# Uber_DSG
This repository contains a data-driven project that aims to predict the demand and supply of Uber rides in a given area based on historical data. The project uses machine learning algorithms and time-series analysis to forecast the number of Uber rides requested and fulfilled.
# Uber Demand-Supply Gap Prediction

## Project Description
This repository hosts a data science project that aims to predict and analyze the demand-supply gap of Uber rides in different areas and times. The project uses historical Uber data and applies machine learning algorithms to forecast the demand and supply of Uber rides. The goal is to help Uber better manage its resources, reduce waiting times for customers, and optimize its service.

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization of Uber ride data.
- Time-series analysis for demand-supply forecasting.
- Machine learning models for prediction.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries mentioned in requirements.txt using pip.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks.

## Usage
You can use this project as a reference for any time-series prediction task or as a base for a more complex demand-supply prediction system.
